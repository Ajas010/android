# TURF BOOKING APP-PITCH TIME

## SUMMARY

The PITCH TIME is a user-friendly mobile application designed to simplify the process of 
booking sports turfs for football, badminton, cricket, and volleyball. It allows players to search for 
available turfs by location, sport, and date, and easily reserve their preferred time slots. In addition 
to turf bookings, the app offers a marketplace where users can rent or purchase sports equipment. 
Turf owners can list their venues, manage bookings, and track revenue efficiently. The app 
integrates secure payment gateways for seamless transactions. With push notifications for 
bookings and reminders, users are kept up-to-date on all their activities. Available on both Android 
and iOS, the app provides a smooth experience for all users. This platform is ideal for both players 
and turf owners, creating a unified space for managing the sport's needs.
